# Aikari aka Platypus
Discord Bot made for fun using Java, and built with Maven. 

Features include playing music, fetching reddit posts, various games, server moderation, Cleverbot, and others.

### Comp 1111 Presentation 
This project was used as a demonstration as part of a project I had to do in Comp 1111, where everyone had to teach one technical skill to the rest of the class.  I decided to demonstrate how to code a simple Discord bot (a much simpler one than this).  The full source code for the Comp 1111 Demonstration is found [here](https://github.com/aiyuni/Aikari/blob/master/desktop/botartifact/DiscordBot.zip)

The JDA dependency and sources jar are required for the the demonstration source code: [download dependency.jar here](https://github.com/aiyuni/Aikari/blob/master/desktop/botartifact/JDA-3.5.0_327-withDependencies.jar) and 
[download sources.jar here](https://github.com/aiyuni/Aikari/blob/master/desktop/botartifact/JDA-3.5.0_327-sources.jar)

### Platypus
Platypus is the name of the bot (that is running this program) found on my Discord servers.
